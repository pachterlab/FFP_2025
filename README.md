# FFP_2025

This folder contains the scripts relating to 'A Joint Biophysical Model for RNA and Protein' by Fang, Felce and Pachter. 

simulation/simulation.ipynb contains the code for creating Figures 2 and 3 from the simulation results.

The monod_source folder contains the source code from Monod. This was the same as the Monod, anndata branch (https://github.com/pachterlab/monod/tree/anndata) on 11/01/2025. 

An example input anndata object is provided, with the fitting code, for each of the gene fits shown in Figure 4, in gene_fitting.

Clustering scripts that were used to subset cells from the filtered RNA data are given in data_processing.
